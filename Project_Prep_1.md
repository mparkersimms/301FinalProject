## Conflict Plan

1. What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

    -  when conflicts arise, in order to fully understand each side, the involved parties will have an opportunity to express themselves and pitch their point of view. 
        - then, the group will vote on the conflict, and a majority rules consensus.  

1. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

    - Members who the group does not feel are contributing adequately will be notified in direct method /communication in the group setting. 

1. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
    
    - if the group finds ourselves in a situation where there is no comprimise, or if we are in a 50/50 split, we will request the assistance of a third party, such as a TA or the instructor. 

## Communication Plan 

1. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

    - via slack group chat

1. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

    - everyone's point of view is important, and we value diverisity. If a decision needs to be made that affects the group as a whole, or applies to the project in any way, the group will have input from each member on a course of action. 

1. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

    - maintain mutual respect for one another. 
    - try to address excessive silence from a team member and address their concerns if there are any. 

## Work Plan

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

    - Our initial plan is to develop a list of task to accomplish given goals that are set, and then organize a linear process to complete those tasks. The group as a whole will work on each task together. The main reason for this initial thought, is so that everyone learns and continues to solidify each concept and aspect of the project. 

1. What project management tool will be used?

    - trello board 

## Git Process 

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?

    - everything that can which excludes node modules, .env file,  and the SQL database.

1. How will you share the repository with your teammates?

    - one member will create the repo, and the other members will fork it and clone it down to their local machines. 

1. What is your Git flow?

    - ACP between features,
    - each member will have their own branch
    - we will avoid git merge conflicts by having only one driver making changes to the repo at a time. 

1. Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

    1. How many people must review a PR?

        - at least one other person

    1. Who merges PRs?
        
        - the person that makes the review merges the PR

    1. How often will you merge?

        - we will merge once the PR has been reviewed and pulled

    1. How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

        - as a group we will merge once everyone has given a verbal acknowledgement.
